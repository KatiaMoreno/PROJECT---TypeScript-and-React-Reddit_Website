# PROJECT - TypeScript and React: Reddit_Website
In this project is part of my undergraduate course in ICT, I am going to implement the front-end and back-end for a simplified version of the website Reddit.

----------------------

# BACK-END
# Implementing a REST API with TypeScript and Node.js 
In this project, I am going to implement the REST API for a for a simplified version of the website Reddit.

# Technologies used: 
TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, TypeORM, and Postgres(Sqlectron).

# back-end
To complete this practice you are going to need to install Node.js, TypeScript, and ts-node. You will also need to create a package.json file and a tsconfig.json file. You are going to need to change the default configuration in the tsconfig.json 

----------------------

# FRONT-END

# Implementing a Web UI with TypeScript and React

In this project, we are going to implement the front-end for a simplified version of the website Reddit. The user will be able to create an account/ login and post links and comments. Other users will then be able to upvote and downvote the links.

The application was implemented using the technologies: TypeScript and React.

To complete this practice you are going to need to create a new React application using the react-create-app command:
Create-react-app ca-2-answer --typescript

----------------------



# Sqlectron - Postgres
to created database 

# Git Bash - command line
open in differents windons with names:
CA2/CA-1-ANSWER (back-end)
CA2/CA-2-ANSWER (front-end)

# npm install 
in both: to install the node_modules

# npm start
npm start will runs the app, automatically will open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
